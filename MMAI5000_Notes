Problem
-Handle
-Decision Making
-Challenge
-Not routine

A set of barries to achieve objectives

A process to remove or overcome the barries by perform a sequence of 
activities

1.Not all problems are well-defined
2.Not all problems are solveable
  Lack of clearity on barriers
  The barriers are clear, but lack of resourse to overcome
  Or could the mix of both
3.A problem solving could be just 1 step

Well Defined + Solvable Problem
Algorithm
-A sequence of activities to be processed for getting desired output 
from given inputs
Before writing an algorithm â†’ You need to identify inputs available to you
and the desired output

Input (100 dollar items) -----output(how much money we left)
assignment operator
Starting Point                Termination Point
