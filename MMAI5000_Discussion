1.What were the top three business objectives of the project?

- Performed detailed research into North American market for project collaboration tools, supporting company's self-developed "TeamsStrength" tool.
- Conducted competitor analysis based on established criteria to understand benefits of similar tools in market from perspective of current and future customers, costs and organizational impact.
- Strategically highlighting potential risks and opportunities for targeting new customers.


2.In an ideal scenario, what specific benefits (e.g, higher sales, better customer experience, competitive positioning, etc.) the project would bring to the client?

- A full development platform/ tool for clients to work on project as the platform will include most of the usable/ commonly used 
function to it, become a all-functional project collaboration tool. SO the clients can subscribe fot the plan and we can take a higher percentagre of market at the similar level.
